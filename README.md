## The Learning App

Develop pseudo distance learning applications or online educational tools for remote learning that allow users to interact and a “classroom-like” environment. Our solution includes :-

- Users can register as Student, Teacher or Parents.
- Virtual study group — Students can meet up on a common forum and prepare for their exams along with other students that are studying for the same subject matter.
- Parents can check the Announcement for any announcement (like snow/rainy day holidays, reports cards, fee due dates, attendance as well as upcoming school events) rather than communicating via email. 
-  Teachers can upload photos which can be viewed by Students and Parents.
